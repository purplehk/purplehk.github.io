					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>My final project is to build a portfolio website for my small business marketing consultancy. I started with something in the previous weeks, but during the time we took to build our partner's websites, I realized I want to go in a different direction with my site layout. I've seen many different corporate B2B sites, especially those done by agencies/creative firms. Some of the specific ones I can think of off the top of my head belong to companies I used to work for such as <a href="http://www.360i.com/" title="360i" alt="www.360i.com">www.360i.com</a> and <a href="http://www.fluidhk.com/" title="fluidhk" alt="www.fluidhk.com">www.fluidhk.com</a>. I've also done a fair amount of looking around Themeforest because I used to use pre-made themes to create websites for my clients. I think my brain remembers little things here and there of what I like, and I try to piece it all together.</p>

					<h2>Strengths</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="strong">General sense of user experience</span> - I think I have a good sense of ease of usability, though I do want to work more on focal point and general flow</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Simple, clean design</span> - I've always been a fan of websites with simple, clean design, so I'm happy to implement it in my site</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Attention to detail</span> - I try to make sure that things are lined up, or hover states or colors are matching, etc.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="col3">
					<h2>Struggles</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="strong">Typography</span> - I'm not well-versed in Typography, figuring out what works with what, so it always takes me a lot longer to find typefaces and font styles I like</li>
						<li><span class="strong">General Style</span> - I want my site to have character, not to be too generic, but at the same time not so strange that it suffers in usability</li>
					</ul>

					<img src="images/business-of-fashion.png" title="Business of Fashion" alt="Business of Fashion Screenshot">
					<ul class="review-list">
						<li><span class="strong">Layout</span> - two column, clear header</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Typography</span> - consistent serif typeface for headers and paragraph with a sans serif for the byline, captions are italicized for emphasis </li>
						<li><span class="strong">Navigation</span> - horizontal navigation, very clear across the top</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Overall Flow</span> - Z-layout, clear focal points on the logo, nav and hero image</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Other Notes</span> - use of colors to denote content category, Chinese site has a different layout because Chinese text can look very cluttered</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Spectrum Powderworks</h2>
				<div id="spectrum" class="clearfix">
					<img src="images/spectrum-powderworks.png" title="Spectrum Powderworks" alt="Spectrum Powderworks">
					<ul class="review-list">
						<li><span class="strong">Layout</span> - single column</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Typography</span> - same sans serif font for logo and navigation with a different sans serif font when hovering over images, colors of navigation make it not very noticeable, logo font makes it seem a bit spooky, unreliable, unprofessional + red is a bit intense, the repeat watermark of the logo is also very strange</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Navigation</span> - seems to be too many navigation options: the images themselves and then the bottom navigation</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Overall Flow</span> - unclear where the focal point is: at first I want to use the bottom navigation because it is the most obvious, but then I see that there are more links when hovering over the images</li>
						<li><span class="strong">Other Notes</span> - hard to understand what the image behind the logo text is, too much animation is distracting</li>
